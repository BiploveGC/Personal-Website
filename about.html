                <p>Hi My name is Biplove GC.
                <p> I a senior at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF), majoring in computer science. My skills in game development are broad and hands-on. Through various projects, I’ve taken on core roles in programming, design, art, animation, writing, and project management. 
                    I’m proficient in multiple coding languages, including C++, C#, Java, and Assembly x86, and I’m experienced with game engines and tools like Unity, Godot, and Unreal Engine.
                    In addition to my technical skills, I also have strong soft skills, such as communication, teamwork, and problem-solving. I am able to work effectively with others to bring my game development visions to life.
                    I am also able to think critically and solve problems in a timely and efficient manner. Currently, I'm working at Masala wave as Team Lead. In my current role at Masala waves, I was tasked with selecting and implementing a new Point-of-Sale (POS) system. 
                    After evaluating various options based on client requirements, I successfully implemented the system, and the client has been extremely satisfied with the results. 
                    This experience enhanced my problem-solving abilities, project management skills, and ability to engage with customers
